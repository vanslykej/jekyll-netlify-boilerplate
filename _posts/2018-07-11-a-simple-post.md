China has one of the longest and most complex histories of any country in the world. If you are a hardcore traveler, there are countless reasons to visit China, but some include the Forbidden City in Beijing, the Great Wall, and the terracotta soldiers of Xi'an. Travel to China also allows an opportunity to see a thriving world power, and it is reflected in the skyscrapers of Pudong and the explosive growth in other cities. Wherever you go, a China travel guide is essential as you navigate this huge nation.

### Things Not to Miss in China
China is slightly smaller than the United States in square miles and home to four times as many people, so it is impossible to see everything. However, these are some of the most famous sites including iconic monuments and natural wonders:

- The Great Wall of China
- The Forbidden City
- The Terracotta Soldiers in Xi'an
- Shanghai
- Chengdu's pandas

### When to Go to China
In the northeast, summers can be hot and winters bitterly cold, while the southern half of the country has a more semi-tropical climate. In general, the best times to travel in terms of weather are the spring and fall.
