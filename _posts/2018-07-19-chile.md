### When to Go to Chile
Because of Chile’s length extending along the continent, its seasons vary from place to place. The best time to visit southern Chile, including Torres del Paine, is the summer (December through March) since they become difficult to explore during the winter. The summer days are long; allowing more time to experience all the country has to offer. In the north, summer is the rainy season, which means afternoon rain showers. Central Chile travel is best in the spring or during fall harvest. Winter can be a great time for skiers in the country’s mountain resorts. The capital, Santiago, is best visited during the summer.
