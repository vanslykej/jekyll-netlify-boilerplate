### When to Go to Spain
Spain's weather is often attributed to a sunny Mediterranean climate, however this large country is actually divided into three distinct weather regions. The best time to visit Spain will depend on your travel plans and where you plan on visiting, but generally the early part of summer and beginning of autumn are good times to visit most regions. The south enjoys a Mediterranean climate with mild, wet winters and warm, dry summers. The central plains, including Madrid, have a more extreme climate, with hotter summers and colder winters.
