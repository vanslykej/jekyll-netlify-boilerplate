Again, France is a country rich in history, making it home to some of the most famous museums, monuments, architectural feats and historical sites in the world. One advantage to France is that travel is easy and visitors will find that it is relatively easy to navigate even with language barriers and that should appeal to tourists looking for a budget-friendly vacation.
