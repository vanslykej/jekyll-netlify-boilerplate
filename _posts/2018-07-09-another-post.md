Australia is an incredibly diverse island, continent, and country- both culturally and geographically speaking. The widely recognized “Outback” takes up the center of the giant island, but most other areas contain everything from rainforests, to mountains and canyons, to world-famous beaches. Nearly all of Australia’s population lives within 50 miles of the coastline. As a former [penal colony, the country is now a mixture of modern cosmopolitan culture and ancient Aboriginal traditions. The cities of Perth, Melbourne, and Sydney are scenic and thriving melting pots. The country itself deserves many trips of discovery, or at least a two-week hiatus to explore some of its key places.

Although the peak travel season in the most popular parts of Australia is during their winter, the most pleasant time to travel to Australia is from April through September. Daytime temperatures are warm, and it rarely rains. September and October are ideal, when the warmth is sufficient to shield you on the beach in the southern states and the wildflowers of Western Australia are in bloom.
