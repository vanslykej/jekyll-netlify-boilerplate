### When to Go to Spain
While most people associate Spain with a sunny Mediterranean climate, this large country is actually divided into three distinct weather regions. So the best time to visit Spain will depend on your travel plans and where you're heading, but generally the early part of summer and beginning of autumn are good times to visit most regions. This aside, the coastal south enjoys a Mediterranean climate with mild, wet winters and warm, dry summers. The central plains, including Madrid, have a more extreme climate, with hotter summers and colder winters. While the mountain areas get the most rain. The Basque country to the north has a maritime climate and is cooler and wetter.
