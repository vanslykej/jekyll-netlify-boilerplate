Where does one begin with Italy? Italy is the land of mouthwatering meals that last all night, heady wines to drink underneath olive trees, pastel villas built into sheer cliffs above the crystal blue Tyrrhenian Sea, and Renaissance paintings and marble sculptures that leave you awestruck and inspired. It is everyone’s dream to travel to Italy, and for good reason. Whether you are heading to the beach or to the mountains, to the vineyards or to the cities, there are endless possibilities for exciting Italy travel. Check out Travel + Leisure’s Italy travel guide to decide what to eat, where to stay and what to see.

A good place to start is the capital city of Rome, the birthplace of Western civilization and the site of many epic historical events. All the regions of Italy are different and cater to different kinds of vacations—from skiing in the Dolomites to sunning on the Aeolian Islands.
