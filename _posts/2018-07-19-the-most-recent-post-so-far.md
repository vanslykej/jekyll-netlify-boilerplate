For a tourist, it can be intimidating to plan a trip to Italy because of all there is to do. It is many people's dream to travel to Italy because of the vast history and culture it provides. Whether you are heading to the beach or to the mountains, to the vineyards or to the cities, there are endless possibilities for exciting Italy travel. Rome is a good place to start, where Western civilization started and the site of many historical events. The regions of Italy all provide a different kind of vacationâ€”from skiing in the Dolomites to relaxing on the Aeolian Islands.

### When to Go to Italy
The Mediterranean climate of Italy makes it a year-round destination with many activities fit for every season. Usually, the summers are hot and dry and the winters are cold and damp. For the most part, the best months to visit Italy are April to June and September to October when the weather is warm. July and August can be extremely hot and humid, and most Italians go on holiday in August, leaving shops and restaurants open to tourists.
