There are few–if any–cultures with a history as long, complicated, and fascinating as China's. For many travelers there are countless reasons to visit China, but some include the Forbidden City in Beijing, the Great Wall, and the terracotta soldiers of Xi'an. But travel to China also allows an opportunity to see a thriving world power, whose might is reflected in the skyscrapers of Pudong and the explosive growth in other cities. Wherever you go, a China travel guide is essential as you navigate this huge nation.

### Things Not to Miss in China
Slightly smaller than the United States in square miles and home to four times as many people, China is impossible to see in its entirety in one visit. A list of must-see sights, however, might start with these iconic monuments and natural wonders:

- The Great Wall of China
- The Forbidden City
- The Terracotta Soldiers in Xi'an
- Shanghai
- Chengdu's pandas

### When to Go to China
In the northeast, summers can be hot and winters bitterly cold, while the southern half of the country has a more semi-tropical climate. In general the best times to travel in terms of weather are the spring and fall.
