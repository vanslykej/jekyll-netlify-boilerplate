Australia is known for being incredibly diverse- both culturally and geographically. The famous “Outback” takes up the center of the giant island, but most other areas contain everything from rainforests, to mountains and canyons, to world-famous beaches. Nearly all of Australia’s population lives within 50 miles of the coastline. The cities of Perth, Melbourne, and Sydney are scenic and filled with endless cultural diversity which is why they have been called melting pots. With all this country has to offer, it deserves consideration for not just one but multiple trips.

### Things Not to Miss in Australia
A visit to Australia guarantees fantastic sightseeing, nightlife, and adventurous experiences to remember forever. Some key things to see in Australia are:

 * Samurai Beach bungalows in New South Wales
 * Bondi Beach in Sydney
 * The Royal Botanic Gardens in Melbourne
 * Sydney Opera House
 * St. Kilda Foreshore in Melbourne
 * The Stirling Hotel

### When to Go to Australia
The best time for traveling to Australia is between mid-April to late August, when air travel is the least expensive. The peak travel season in the most popular parts of Australia is during the winter. If you are a fan of warm weather the most pleasant time to travel to Australia is from April through September. Daytime temperatures are warm, and it rarely rains. If you are not a fan of warm weather, September and October are ideal, when the warmth is sufficient to shield you on the beach in the southern states and the wildflowers of Western Australia are in bloom.
