### When to Go to France
As with any country of its size, climates vary widely across France with cities in the north and northwestern reaches of the country experiencing temperate climates (Parisian summers rarely exceed daily temperatures of 80 degrees) and the southeastern swaths of France weathering Mediterranean climates complete with warm, humid summers and mild, cool winters. Still, spring and summer is the best time to visit France if only for a chance at taking in the best weather the country has to offer. Unless, of course, you’re hoping to take part in more wintry activities. In that case, the best time to visit France and the French Alps is between December and March.
