### When to Go to Chile
Chile has a complex climate because of the fact that it runs along the edge of the continent. The best time to visit southern Chile is the summer (December through March) because they are difficult to explore during the winter. The summer days are long; allowing more time to experience all the country has to offer. In the north, summer is the rainy season. Central Chile travel is best in the spring or during fall harvest. If you enjoy skiing, winter is a great time to visit the countryâ€™s mountain resorts. The capital, Santiago, is best visited during the summer.
